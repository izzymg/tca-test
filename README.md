# TCA Web Engineer Assessment

## Requirements

1. **Fork** this repo.
2. The project has numerous errors in its CSS, HTML and Javascript, correct these.
3. Add code to `assets/script.js` so that when you click on the image of the sphynx cat, it opens in a modal/popup gallery. You can add as much CSS and HTML to do this as you want to. 
4. Update the weather widget to also show the unit the temperature is in using the API.
5. If you want to show your skills off somehow else, go for it, but this is not required to be considered successful.
6. When you're finished, invite me to collaborate on your fork repo.
